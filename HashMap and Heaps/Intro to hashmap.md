What is a Hashmap?
A hashmap is a data structure which has an amazing property that most of the operations which we perform on it are done in O(1) time complexity. The data is stored in a hash-map in the form of key-value pairs. For instance: consider the following data about the population of various countries:

Creating hashmap
public static void main(String[] args)
{
HashMap< String, Integer> hm = new HashMap< >();
System.out.println(hm);
}
